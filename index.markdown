    <div style="flex: 2; padding-right: 20px;">
        <p>
            Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Padova, 
            working under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.dei.unipd.it/~silvestri/index.html">Francesco Silvestri</a>
            and co-supervised by Prof. <a href="https://itu.dk/~maau/">Martin Aum√ºller</a>. 
            My research spans both theoretical and applied domains, with a focus on differential privacy, 
            probability and statistics, and randomized algorithms. 
            Additionally, I collaborate with <a href="https://www.motionanalytica.com/en/homepage-en/">Motion Analytica srl</a> on mobility research. 
            I am interested in any research topic that regards trustworthy AI, and I am open to collaborations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my studies in Theoretical Physics at the University of Padova where I developed
strong foundations in mathematics, statistical physics and complex systems.

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, calisthenics, and playing music.

- I am a hiking guide assistant for [The South Adventure](https://www.thesouthadventures.com)
- I play bass, guitar, and a bit of piano. I was part of a band and contributed to publishing an album titled [L'assenzio](https://open.spotify.com/track/5JHud3qLhBnuEdVKlqzcY3).
- I used to compose music and might return to it in the future. Here are some of my songs on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-373535867).
