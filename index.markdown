### Academic & Professional Experience

* **Research Background:** Prior to my PhD, I completed my studies in **Theoretical Physics** at the University of Padova, which provides the mathematical foundation for my current work in randomized algorithms.
* **Visiting Research:** In 2024, I was a visiting PhD student at the **IT University of Copenhagen**, working with [Prof. Rasmus Pagh](https://rasmuspagh.net) as part of the [Providentia project](https://www.rasmuspagh.net/providentia/).
* **Industry Collaboration:** I collaborate with [Motion Analytica srl](https://www.motionanalytica.com/en/homepage-en/) on mobility research. Our collaborative work was recently published in a peer-reviewed journal, bridging the gap between theory and real-world mobility applications.

## Beyond the Lab

In my spare time, I prioritize staying active and creative:

* **Hiking:** I am a hiking guide assistant for [The South Adventure](https://www.thesouthadventures.com).
* **Music:** I play bass, guitar, and a bit of piano. I was previously part of a band and contributed to the album **[L'assenzio](https://open.spotify.com)** (Spotify).
* **Composition:** I enjoy writing and producing music; you can listen to some of my tracks on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-373535867).
