## About Me

Hi! I am a **PhD Candidate** in Computer Science at the University of Padova. I have recently completed my doctoral research and am currently awaiting my thesis defense. 

My work is supervised by [Prof. Francesco Silvestri](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~silvestri/index.html) and co-supervised by [Prof. Martin Aumüller](https://itu.dk/~maau/). My research spans both theoretical and applied domains, with a core focus on **Differential Privacy** and **Data Structures** for high dimensional data.

> 🚀 **On the Job Market:** Having completed my doctoral studies, I am now seeking opportunities in Research or Applied Science starting in 2026.

### Academic & Professional Experience

* **Research Background:** Prior to my PhD, I completed my studies in **Theoretical Physics** at the University of Padova, which provides the mathematical foundation for my current work in randomized algorithms.
* **Visiting Research:** In 2024, I was a visiting PhD student at the **IT University of Copenhagen**, working with [Prof. Rasmus Pagh](https://rasmuspagh.net) as part of the [Providentia project](https://www.rasmuspagh.net/providentia/) and my co-supervisor [Prof. Martin Aumüller](https://itu.dk/~maau/).
* **Industry Collaboration:** I collaborate with [Motion Analytica srl](https://www.motionanalytica.com/en/homepage-en/) on mobility research. Our collaborative work was recently published in a peer-reviewed journal [link](https://www.mdpi.com/2412-3811/11/1/4).

## Beyond the Lab

In my spare time, I prioritize staying active and creative:

* **Hiking:** I am a hiking guide assistant for [The South Adventure](https://www.thesouthadventures.com).
* **Music:** I play bass, guitar, and a bit of piano. I was previously part of a band and contributed to the album **[L'assenzio](https://open.spotify.com)** (Spotify).
* **Composition:** I enjoy writing and producing music; you can listen to some of my tracks on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-373535867).
* **Fitness:** I love calisthenics.
