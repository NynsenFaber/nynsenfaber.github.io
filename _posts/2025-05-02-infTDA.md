title: "Paper Accepted at Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy 2025"
---

This year I'll present at the workshop **Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy 2025** (TPDP 2025) at Google Mountain View, California, USA, a
paper titled **InfTDA: a Simple TopDown Mechanism for Hierarchical Differentially Private Counting Queries**.

The paper generalizes the work done with Prof. Francesco Silvestri on **Differential Privacy Releasing of Hierarchical Origin/Destination Data with a TopDown Approach**
(PETS 2025) for any tabular data with hierarchical structure. 

You can download the paper [here](/documents/InfTDA.pdf).
