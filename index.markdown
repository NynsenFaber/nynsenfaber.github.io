## About Me

Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Padova,
working under the supervision of [Prof. Francesco Silvestri](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~silvestri/index.html)
and co-supervised by [Prof. Martin Aum√ºller](https://itu.dk/~maau/).
My research spans both theoretical and applied domains, with a focus on differential privacy,
probability and statistics, and randomized algorithms.
Additionally, I collaborate with [Motion Analytica srl](https://www.motionanalytica.com/en/homepage-en/) on mobility research.
I am interested in any research topic that regards trustworthy AI, and I am open to collaborations.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my studies in Theoretical Physics at the University of Padova.

## Hobbies
In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, calisthenics, and playing music.

- I am a hiking guide assistant for [The South Adventure](https://www.thesouthadventures.com)
- I play bass, guitar, and a bit of piano.  I was part of a band and contributed to publishing an album titled [L'assenzio](https://open.spotify.com/track/5JHud3qLhBnuEdVKlqzcY3).
- I was used to compose music, maybe in the future I will do it again. Here some of my songs [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-373535867).
